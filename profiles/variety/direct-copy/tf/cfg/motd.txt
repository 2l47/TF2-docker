Welcome to Variety.TF!

Our servers are catered towards players who want a bot-less, vanilla, casual-like experience but are tired of constantly playing on the same maps and desire a fresher experience.

We feature 9 sets of community-contributed and official maps that rotate on a daily basis.

You can nominate a map to play next by typing "!nominate" in chat, and vote to change maps by typing "rtv".

If the teams feel unbalanced, you can vote for a scramble by saying "scramble".
